      Hello! I'm Cristian Pulido, a passionate application developer currently working at 
      <strong>Hospital Virgen del Roc√≠o in Seville</strong>, where I develop medical software 
      solutions to improve healthcare processes and patient care. I completed my higher degree

      and practical training in programming and software development.

      technologies including <strong>TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Java, 
      Spring Boot, Docker, Tailwind CSS, HTML, CSS, SQL and NoSQL Databases, Node.js, 
      and Express</strong>. I continuously expand my skill set to stay current with 
      modern development practices and emerging technologies.

      As a software developer, <strong>I have developed various projects ranging from 
      e-commerce platforms to medical software</strong>, all visible on my GitHub.
